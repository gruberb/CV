\vspace{8pt} % Gap between title and text
Well rounded Software Engineer, Team Lead and published Author ("Rust Web Development" - Manning). I thrive in an environment where I can dive deep into a new problem space, develop solutions with multiple stakeholders involved and thinking through a product end-to-end. I worked for StartUps developing both backend and frontend applications, distributed systems as a Systems Engineer and in client facing roles as a Solutions Architect. I love technology and building tools to elevate customer experiences and solve their problems. I founded the "Rust\&Tell Berlin" MeetUp, which had the largest following globally, and engage with the local tech community wherever I live.
